          p.explanation-block__text It’s simple, really. 50 million people in the United States skip medication due to cost. Medication destruction costs $1-$3 per pound. And 70% of waterways are contaminated with pharmaceutical runoff. Your donations make a real, lasting impact.

                p.accordion__title Can individuals donate? What if I have extra medicine in my medicine cabinet? 
                .accordion__panel Yes. Although SIRUM only accepts medication donations from organizations at this time, if you follow the instructions below, we can help your medication get into the right hands through one of our partners.
              li.faq__list-item.accordion
                p.accordion__title Is this program free?
                .accordion__panel Upon joining, donors can choose whether to donate based on a list of approved medications, which is free, or donate all of their unexpired, unopened, non-controlled medication, which costs a nominal fee.
              li.faq__list-item.accordion
                p.accordion__title Why should I donate medicine when I can return them for credit?
                .accordion__panel Returning and donating are not exclusive, just donate the medicine you are not getting credit for.  When looking at their credit statement, many organizations find that most of their medication is not creditable and can save more money with potential tax deductions than they currently get in credit.

                p.accordion__title Can I donate expired medications?
                .accordion__panel We do not accept expired, opened, or controlled medications.  We can sometimes accept refrigerated medications such as insulin. Upon joining, donors can choose whether to donate based on a list of approved medications, which is free, or donate all of their unexpired, unopened, non-controlled medication, which costs a nominal fee.
              li.faq__list-item.accordion
                p.accordion__title Do you accept all medications?
                .accordion__panel We do not accept expired, opened, or controlled medications.  We can sometimes accept refrigerated medications such as insulin. 
              li.faq__list-item.accordion

              li.faq__list-item.accordion
                p.accordion__title How are matches made?
                .accordion__panel Our technology platform allows donor facilities to find a recipient clinic whose needs match their surplus. Donor facilities use fax or an online system to upload their surplus, and recipient clinics upload a list of medications to create a “formulary” of their commonly prescribed drugs. Donors choose from among the matching recipients by reviewing factors such as geographic proximity, percent matches, and name recognition.
              li.faq__list-item.accordion
                p.accordion__title How does shipping work?
                .accordion__panel When the SIRUM box or mailer is full, just put on the pre-paid shipping label that we sent you after registration and let us know that the donation is ready. We will schedule a courier pick-up for the next day. Medicine is sent directly to the recipient and arrives within 2-3 days; donors and recipients can track the progress of the shipment online and with email notifications.  We can also provide any shipping supplies you may need including boxes (for large donations), padded mailers (for small donations), and packing tape.
              li.faq__list-item.accordion
                p.accordion__title What does unopened/sealed mean?
                .accordion__panel Donated medicine must have a tamper-evident seal around the medication.  Bubble packs, blister packs, and bingo cards even if they only have a few pills left are okay.  Outer packaging can be opened if there is an inner seal, such as a foil around inhalation solutions, even though the box was opened.

                p.accordion__title What records do I need to keep?
                .accordion__panel SIRUM works closely with each state to determine and create the appropriate donation records.  In most cases your record keeping process will remain the same as your return or destruction record with SIRUM automatically transforming those records into those necessary for donation.  Keep the record for your files, you do not need to put the record in the box.  All records are available through your online account.
              li.faq__list-item.accordion
                p.accordion__title Is this legal?
                .accordion__panel Yes.  Donation is a new option.  SIRUM works under each state’s recently-passed Good Samaritan Laws for Drug Donation.  We are among the world’s leading experts on drug donation laws and regulations.
              li.faq__list-item.accordion
                p.accordion__title What about patient information (HIPAA)?
                .accordion__panel When you register with SIRUM, we become your Business Associate and a Business Associate Addendum (BAA) requires us to maintain the the privacy and confidentiality of any medications that may still have patient information.  We take this obligation very seriously and have strict protocols in place.
